public class H_must_learn_before_come_to_next_class { // Start of the class body
	
	// This is called class body
	// What a class body contains?	
	// First: Class body contain variables
	// Those variables can be either declared (no value assigned) or initialized (value assigned) 
	
	// here, public is access modifier, String is the type of the variable, myName is the name of the String type variable
	public String myName; // Variable is declared, no value assigned
	// here, public is access modifier, String is the type of the variable, schoolName is the name of the variable
	public String schoolName = "Enthrall IT"; // Variable is initialized, a value is assigned
	
	public String family_name;
	// variable name starts with lower case and follow camel case and snake case pattern 
	// String type values are always inside double quotation
		
	// int is the type of the variable, myAge is the name of the int type variable
	public int myAge = 100;
	// int type values are with no quotation
	
	// char is the type of the variable, mySex is the name of the char type variable
	public char mySex = 'M';
	// char type values are always inside single quotation
	
	// boolean is the type of the variable, usCitizen is the name of the boolean type variable
	public boolean usCitizen = true;
	// boolean type values are with no quotation. Represented by 'true' or 'false' in lower case only	
	
	// Second: Class body also contains Constructor after variables.
	// Those Constructor can be either declared or initialized
	
	// Third: Class body also contains methods
	// Those methods can be either implemented or initialized. (very important info)
	// Inside the class, method can't be declared  (very important info)
	
	// After method, main method can come if we create
	public static void main(String[] args) { // Start of the main method body
		// main method body
		System.out.println("Print");
	} // End of the main method body
	

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

} // End of the class body
